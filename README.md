# The Vortex Project

This project is built with:

- webpack
- react
- express
- axios
- sass

The Vortex Project is a website dedicated to all things Doctor Who. I'm a huge fan of the BBC series, and wanted to show my love while diving deeper into my frontend skills. The website includes the latest Doctor Who news articles scraped from the BBC's Doctor Who homepage, as well as consuming data from the [Doctor Who API I created](https://github.com/Alliemack77/Dr-Who-API).

The goal of this project was to build a react app from scratch, without the use of create-react-app. I based the webpack congifuration on Brad Traversy's [*Webpack 5 Crash Course*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs).
