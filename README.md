# The Vortex Project

This project is built with:

- webpack
- react
- express
- axios
- sass
- [Doctor Who Mock API](https://github.com/Alliemack77/Dr-Who-API)

The Vortex Project is a website dedicated to all things Doctor Who. I'm a huge fan of the BBC series, and wanted to show my love, all while developing my full-stack skills. 

The project is a react app built from scratch (without using create-react-app). My goal was to learn more about Webpack and how to write a basic configuration. I based the webpack congifuration on Brad Traversy's [*Webpack 5 Crash Course*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs). 

Another goal of this project was to include a mini-backend. The website includes the latest Doctor Who news articles scraped from the BBC's Doctor Who homepage. The data is collected using a webscraper I built using express and cheerio (an implementation of core jQuery designed specificly for the server) with the help of Ania Kubow's [*Build a Web Scraper*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3lqUHeZs_0). 

Lastly, this project uses the [Doctor Who Mock API I created](https://github.com/Alliemack77/Dr-Who-API) to populate data for character/episode articles. I build the API using json-server with the help of Ania Kubow's [*Make your own mock API*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLnxgSZ0DG4).
